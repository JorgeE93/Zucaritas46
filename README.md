My name is Jorge and I am a CS Major at California State University, Northridge! I am growing more comfortable with using git and python every day and most of my commits are python projects that I've worked on to increase my familiarity with the language.

I am pursuing a career in Machine Learning, and as my skills develop and I approach more real world projects, I follow that path with a passion to learn!

I am always available to collaborate with others and look forward to meeting new people!
